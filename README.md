# PassClass
This is an MVC app for users of the fitness website ClassPass. It enables you to register for the most in-demand classes precisely at noon without being at your computer. The app scrapes ClassPass for a list of the user's favorite studios and uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. The user can login any time before noon to see each studio's schedule and add/remove classes to a cart for sign-up. The app has a countdown timer and will post the user's preferences at noon (as determined by Network Time Protocol). Finally, the app will check which sign-up requests were successful and notify the user.

Get sweatin'!
